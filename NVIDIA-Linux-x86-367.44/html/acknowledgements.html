<p><code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code> was inspired by
the <code class="filename">loki_update</code> tool: <a href=
"http://icculus.org/loki_setup/" target=
"_top">http://icculus.org/loki_setup/</a></p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">snarf</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The FTP and HTTP support in <code class=
"filename">nvidia-installer</code> is based upon <code class=
"filename">snarf 7.0</code>: <a href="http://www.xach.com/snarf/"
target="_top">http://www.xach.com/snarf/</a></p>
<p>The source code for nvidia-installer, including the FTP/HTTP
code based on snarf, is available at: <a href=
"ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-installer/" target=
"_top">ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-installer/</a></p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">makeself</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The self-extracting archive (also known as the <code class=
"filename">.run</code> file) is generated using <code class=
"filename">makeself.sh</code>: <a href=
"http://www.megastep.org/makeself/" target=
"_top">http://www.megastep.org/makeself/</a></p>
<p>The version of makeself.sh used to create the .run is bundled
within the .run file, and can retrieved by extracting the .run
file's contents, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-367.44.run --extract-only
$ ls -l NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-367.44/makeself.sh
